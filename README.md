## üéØProblem Statement
HR teams struggled to correlate employee performance metrics (salary hikes, overtime, work-life balance) with job satisfaction and attrition risks. Manual Excel reports were time-consuming, and leadership lacked real-time insights to improve retention.

## üîé Key Findings & Recommendations

##### 1. Salary Hike Impact on Performance & Satisfaction
 - Employees with higher salary hikes (15-20%) had better performance ratings (avg. 3.09 in Development vs. 2.78 in Finance).

 - Lower hikes (10-15%) correlated with lower job satisfaction (avg. 2.65 in Sales vs. 2.95 in Data Science).

 - Recommendation: Consider targeted salary adjustments for underperforming departments to boost morale and productivity.

##### 2. Overtime Work Reduces Job Satisfaction
 - Employees working overtime reported lower satisfaction (avg. 2.50 in Data Science vs. 2.93 in HR).

 - Overtime also impacted productivity, with higher risks of burnout and depression.

 - Recommendation: Implement workload balancing policies to reduce overtime dependency.

##### 3. Work-Life Balance Drives Performance
 - Employees with "Best" work-life balance had higher performance ratings (e.g., 3.05 in Data Science).

 - Departments like HR (avg. 2.93 rating) prioritized work-life balance, leading to better retention.

 - Recommendation: Promote flexible work policies to improve employee well-being and efficiency.

##### 4. Department-Specific Insights
 - Data Science had the highest salary hikes (16.45%) but lowest overtime (0%), suggesting a balanced workload.

 - Sales showed moderate satisfaction (2.77) despite lower hikes (15.15%), indicating non-monetary motivators (e.g., incentives).

 - HR excelled in work-life balance (3.13) but lagged in salary hikes (14.74%), hinting at compensation trade-offs.

##### 5. Tenure & Performance Correlation
 - Employees who worked at 1-3 companies had the highest performance ratings (2,178 records).

 - Frequent job-changers (8-11 companies) showed lower ratings (229 records), suggesting stability boosts performance.

 - Recommendation: Focus on employee retention strategies (e.g., career growth, recognition).
